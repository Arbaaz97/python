### CAPSTONE PROJECT

#### Day 23 of 100 Days of Python
#### Project name: Turtle Crossing Game
#### Things I implemented: Turtle, Inheritance, Game Logic, Random

#### The Game is different from the course, since I added a main menu and probably different logic in the game
#### It will not work well when you play them in repl.it
