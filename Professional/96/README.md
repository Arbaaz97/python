#### Day 96 of 100 Days of Python
#### Project name: Online Shop
#### Things I Implemented: Web Development, Database

#### This project supposedly includes payment processing, but the suggested api don't really include my country and it kinda felt like fraud to me, using sandbox doesn't seem to achieve anything

#### My Approach toward this project
1. Create Flowchart and ERD, design tables
2. Build database, Create basic layout of website(navbar and footer), add categories to the database (save the block of code into ./init/init.txt)
3. User Authentication (login, register, logout) and Mock data for products (taken from amazon, with a little tinkering) -> saved to .csv
4. Insert Mock Data into Database, Add product management functionality (Add new products and Update products), add Admin only decorator, and implemented template filter 
5. Add to Cart function, Pagination, and Search
6. Transaction and Checkout
