#### Day 96 of 100 Days of Python
#### Project name: Online Shop
#### Things I Implemented: Web Development, Database

#### This project supposedly includes payment processing, but the suggested api don't really include my country and it kinda costs me money to use other APIs

#### I'll still include payment processing, just without the payment I guess

#### My Approach toward this project
1. Create Flowchart and ERD, design tables
2. build database, form basic layout of website(navbar and footer), add categories to the database (save the block of code into ./init/init.txt)
3. User Authentication (login, register, logout) and Mock data for products (taken from amazon, with a little tinkering) -> saved to .csv
4. Insert Mock Data into Database, Add product management functionality (Add new products and Update products), add Admin only decorator, and implemented template filter 
5. Add to Cart function, Pagination, and Search
