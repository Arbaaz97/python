# 100DaysOfPython

These are my notes and projects while trying to complete 100 days of Code in Python Course.

course link: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

The notes and projects are put in a folder, sorted by day number and difficulty level

On each day folder, there are course notes (in notes.py if there is any), course content explanation (in CourseContent.txt), project folder (folder = Project),
and exercises (if there are any)

For the Projects, the driver program (where you run the code) uses camelCase, while other supporting files use snake_case

## Projects:
##### Some projects are a little different than the file, since it has been optimized and shortened
##### Some can be run, but have performance issues (repl.it have its limitations)
##### Some can't be run because there are environment variables (API Authentication), but feel free to have a look around the code
##### Some are not put into a link, because it's too complicated to implement again with a dummy account / it uses applications that i use for myself
