# 100DaysOfPython

These are my notes and projects while trying to complete 100 days of Code in Python Course.

course link: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

The notes and projects are put in a folder, sorted by day number and difficulty level

On each day folder, there are course notes (in notes.py if there is any), course content explanation (in CourseContent.txt), project folder (folder = Project),
and exercises (if there are any)

For the Projects, the driver program (where you run the code) uses camelCase, while other supporting files use snake_case
